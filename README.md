# 📖 curatedLearning

The internet as we know it has a huge amount of resources available for all to learn 📚. But as someone who is just starting out with their career it can be a really difficult, sometimes also very confusing choice to make to decide on a course to start with. So, this website was built in order to provide curated lists of free learning resources for various pathways.

The website has a blogs section too where new interesting blogs are uploaded often. The curations section has multiple learning pathways which each have thei resources bifurcated into five sections. There are the Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced Level resources as well as a section that provides Crash Courses and Elective Courses.
